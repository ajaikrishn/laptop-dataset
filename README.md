#laptop price prediction
üîç Feature Engineering & Feature Selection:
Extracted and transformed relevant features such as brand, processor type, RAM size, storage capacity, and more.
Selected the most impactful features to enhance model performance and reduce over fitting.
üß† Model Creation:
Built and trained multiple models to predict laptop prices:
Linear Regression: A straightforward approach providing a baseline for model performance.
Decision Tree: Captured non-linear relationships in the data.
Random Forest: An ensemble method that improved prediction accuracy by combining multiple decision trees.
‚öôÔ∏è Hyper parameter Tuning:
Utilized Randomized Search and Grid Search techniques to fine-tune the hyper parameters of the Random Forest model.
Achieved an impressive R¬≤ score of 0.8555, indicating a strong predictive power and model performance.
Project Insights:
Analyzed and interpreted the influence of different features on the predicted price.
Provided actionable insights for stakeholders to understand market trends and price determinants in the laptop industry.
This project not only showcases my proficiency in machine learning but also highlights my ability to handle end-to-end data science projects, from data preprocessing to model evaluation and deployment.
